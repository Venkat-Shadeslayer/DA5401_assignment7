## ‚öôÔ∏è Models Implemented

| Model | Library | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | `scikit-learn` | Distance-based classification |
| Decision Tree | `scikit-learn` | Tree-based model for interpretability |
| Logistic Regression | `scikit-learn` | Multinomial logistic regression |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | `scikit-learn` | Probabilistic baseline |
| Support Vector Classifier (SVC) | `scikit-learn` | Kernel-based classification |
| Dummy Classifier | `scikit-learn` | Baseline reference |
| *(Optional)* XGBoost | `xgboost` | Gradient boosting (optional extension) |

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The notebook computes:

- **Accuracy**
- **Weighted F1-score**
- **Macro-averaged ROC curves (One-vs-Rest)**
- **Precision‚ÄìRecall curves**

Each model is ranked by performance, with brief synthesis and analysis.
